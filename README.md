# 🛠️ Fluid Control Valve – Design & Simulation (Fusion 360)

This project involves the 3D modeling, assembly, simulation, and rendering of a **fluid control valve** using Autodesk Fusion 360. The objective was to visualize the mechanical structure and working concept of the valve through CAD design and animation.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Design individual components of the fluid control valve
- Assemble them into a complete structure
- Generate exploded views for clarity
- Render the complete design
- Create a disassembly animation for visual presentation
